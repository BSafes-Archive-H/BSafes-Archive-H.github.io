## U.S. Forces’ Withdrawal from Afghanistan is Posing a Real Threat to Women and their Nineteen Years of Achievements
Although the real threat and concerns regarding the failure of the gender policy of the U.S. which now belongs to those women who celebrated victory and thus concerns about the vulnerability of women and their achievements of the past nineteen years, since the invasion of Afghanistan by the U.S. were revealed in 2014, when plans for the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from Afghanistan were announced. Additionally, concerns are growing day by day since 2019, almost two decades after the defeat of the Taliban and the invasion of Afghanistan by the U.S., as U.S.–Taliban peace talks are going on, and once again, Afghan women’s future and destiny is on the U.S.- Taliban peace negotiations table in Qatar.

The U.S. announced its military withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2014 while insecurity was in progress and the Taliban had started targeting civilians as they were regaining power in many parts of Afghanistan. In the words of David Cortright, this announcement of the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan posed a specific risk to women who had used the opportunities offered through U.S. intervention: “While improving the status of women is not the reason U.S. forces intervened in Afghanistan, it has become an important concern as our military begins to withdraw” (8). Cortright’s finding show that Afghan “women face renewed threats. The Taliban regained control in some communities and reactionary former warlords have increased their influence in Kabul’s government” (9). According to Cortright, the U.S. invasion and its policy regarding gender equality and women’s rights during the past thirteen years has proved harmful even to women who are engaged in politics and economics, women who work within the Afghan government, and those who work with international organizations (9). Cortright further argues, “Opposition to continued Western military involvement has produced a backlash against women’s rights, which is seen by some Afghans as an alien imposition. Women who exercise leadership skills are often called anti-Islamic, Western agents, or prostitutes” (9).

Furthermore, studies indicate that women are concerned about their rights and freedom as U.S. representatives and the Taliban are trying to make a peace deal in Doha, Qatar. Since 2019, almost two decades after the defeat of the Taliban and the invasion of Afghanistan by the U.S., once again, Afghan women’s future and destiny are on the U.S.-Taliban peace negotiations table in Doha, Qatar. In 2019, President Donald Trump’s administration announced that the U.S. would start direct peace negotiation with the Taliban to end the twenty-year-long U.S. war in Afghanistan. According to a study by Ashok Behuria, Yaqoob Ul Hassan, and Sanya Saroha, the United States set the agenda of negotiations with the Taliban in September 2018 “by appointing Zalmay Khalilzad as the special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation” (127). Currently, the talks between U.S. representative Khalilzad, the Taliban, and the representatives of the government of Afghanistan are ongoing in Doha. According to Behuria et al., as the U.S. is directly engaged in the peace talks with the Taliban, there is an indication that the Taliban now feels more powerful:

> The rapidly declining security situation inside Afghanistan, ever since the US–Taliban talks began, clearly indicates that the Taliban now, more than ever before, feel morally ascendant, while forces that backed the fledgling democratic experiment in Afghanistan are showing signs of fatigue and frustration (127).

According to Behuria et al., during the peace talks, the Taliban even outlined their non-negotiable list of issues, some of which are as follows:

> The U.S. would not be allowed to discuss internal affairs, the Taliban would not stop killing people supporting occupation forces; and they would only agree to uphold freedom of the press, civil societies, and political organizations … under the framework of Islamic values (128).

According to Behuria et al., “these are red lines that should legitimately worry the U.S. negotiators” (128). Considering the Taliban’s past attitude toward women, these red lines are of great concern for all women in Afghanistan particularly for those women who are engaged in political, social, economic, and other activities out of home, as well. Currently, a great number of active women are asking the Afghan government and the U.S. representative Khalilzad Afghan that women’s rights and achievements should not be compromised during peace talks with the Taliban in Qatar.

In an article titled “Feminism, Peace, and Afghanistan,” Sima Samar argues that the Afghan women are excluded from ongoing peace talks: “peace and negotiation with opposing non-state actors have dominated the current dialogue. Afghan women continue to be excluded from the decision-making processes” (145). She argues that, historically, women have played a central role in the events and process of war and peace in Afghanistan, like the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan which in a huge part was justified in the name of freedom and the rights of women (146). She further warns about the exclusion of women in the current Qatar peace negotiation and says:

> Yet, the current peace negotiation being brokered seems to have forgotten the dire human rights situation of Afghan women and has neglected the fact that their future role within the country will have a significant impact on attaining truly sustainable and long-lasting peace (146).

Throughout its history, Afghanistan has experienced the invasions of several great powers, from Great Britain to the Soviet Union to the U.S. During their stay in power in Afghanistan, every superpower has projected a different lifestyle for Afghan women. During the former Russian occupation of Afghanistan, the USSR-backed government led by Nur Mohmad Taraki for the first time politically utilized women rights: “it was within this time frame where they began utilizing women’s rights as a political tool” (Samar 147). After the defeat of the USSR-backed government of Najibullah and the victory of the mujahidin, with the help of the former U.S. government, women again were forced to stay home and away from public spheres. Succeeding the mujahidin, the Taliban Islamic fundamentalists totally ban women from work, education, and appearing in any public sphere without a “mahram” (a male companion). It was this brutality of the Taliban that helped the Bush administration to justify the war and invasion of Afghanistan.
