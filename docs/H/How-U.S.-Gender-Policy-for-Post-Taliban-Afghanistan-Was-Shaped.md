## Abstract
The United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001, shortly after the 9/11 terroristic attack by Al-Qaeda. Although the U.S. invaded to pursue the leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama Bin-Laden, women’s rights and freedoms in Afghanistan under the Taliban were at the heart of the Bush administration’s agenda of the “war on terror.” Through analysis of existing literature and data, this study seeks to discover how U.S. gender policy for post-Taliban Afghanistan was shaped, and asks, what are its pros and cons? The study indicates that political discourses on women’s rights and freedoms shaped U.S. gender policy for post-Taliban Afghanistan; however, women still suffer from inequality and conflict.
