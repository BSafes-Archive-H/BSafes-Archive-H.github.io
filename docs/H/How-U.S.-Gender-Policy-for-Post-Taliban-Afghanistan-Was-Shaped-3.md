## Impacts of U.S. Gender Policy on Living Conditions of Afghan Women
Although U.S. gender policy opened windows of hope for some Afghan women who were craving freedom and equality in the early years, later it was proved that the gender policy of the U.S. for Afghanistan was entirely fragile and currently seems close to failure. In the early years following the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, the utilization of gender policy there had been accompanied by flows of aid which had opened door for a significant number of women, especially in the capital of Kabul and some big cities. Soon after the fall of the Taliban, the flow of development aid and projects provided women with job opportunities in different sectors. According to a study by Margaret Courtney Barnard conducted in 2014, “…since 2002, USAID has provided more than $17 billion in aid to Afghanistan” (44). She explained that this aid targeted “three main programs… economic growth … the establishment of a democratic and capable state governed by the rule of law, and lastly the provision of basic services for its people” (44). Furthermore, she claimed that since 2001, promotion of women’s education, maternal health, and women’s empowerment were at the top of the U.S. development aid list in Afghanistan (44). According to Barnard’s findings, in the early years after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, the confidence of people toward international NGOs was high: “with regard to national and international NGOs, in 2011, 56% of Afghans placed ‘a lot’ of confidence in international NGOs, in 2012 the number dropped to 53%, and then to 51% in 2013” (36). Focus on the education of girls was another arena that caught the most attention in 2002 and afterward.

According to a 2014 study by Nandini Deo, “since 2001, donors have given almost $2 billion towards rebuilding the overall education system [in Afghanistan], from physical reconstruction to human resources development” (17). According to this study, Afghans constantly insist on education of girls as a tool for a brighter future, and that “while some illiterate fathers may hesitate to support the education of their children, most Afghan parents see education as a key to greater opportunity and social mobility” (17). According to Deo, regardless of the positive opinion toward girls’ education in Afghanistan, the interventionist policy of the West currently has created a negative sensitivity among people in different regions of the country:

> Today the pressure from international donors to adopt gender equality is often met with hostility. Gender mainstreaming, which is the government’s express policy for promoting gender equality, is not succeeding. ‘Members of the civil service widely perceive gender mainstreaming as policy imported from outside the country, and do not generally feel they have ownership of its implementation’ (Anna Larson, 2008, quoted in Deo 15).

Based on another study by Mariam Alamyar, from 2001 to 2004 the number of school enrollments in different regions of Afghanistan increased from one million students to seven million. According to this study, “overall, the number of girls enrollments increased from 839,000 to more than 2.5 million during the same period” (58). According to Alamyar, “in 2008, more than 79,000 students — twenty-six percent of them female — graduated from high school and approximately 110,000 of 160,000 were teachers provided with teacher training” (58). According to the findings of this study, in 2014 about 2,700 students were enrolled in the National Institution of Management and Administration of Kabul University and from 2003 to 2016, the U.S. embassy and USAID in Kabul sent more than 100 students to the United States to pursue masters and bachelor’s degrees each year (59).

In the case of job opportunities for women at the present time, based on the new constitution of Afghanistan, women are reserved twenty-five percent of parliament seats. Many women work in high positions in government institutions, private sectors, and international institutions that are actively operating in Afghanistan. Currently, the chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission is a woman. A significant number of women work in the media industry, women are involved in trade and business, and the list goes on.

However, growing insecurity, the intensification of ongoing conflict, and the active presence of many terroristic networks such as the ISIS militias in the country (as well as the power and recognition from the Unites States the Taliban is getting as U.S.-Taliban negotiations are going on in Doha, Qatar), has caused extreme anxiety among the people of Afghanistan, specifically women. The opportunities and achievements that women in different parts of the country have gained as a result of the implementation of U.S. gender policy and the flow of aid in post-Taliban Afghanistan appears to be extremely fragile, unsustainable, and unmanageable. As many scholars argue, promoting gender equality from the outside in a maledominated country with a 99.9% Muslim population is proving not to be an idea welcomed by all citizens of that country. From the very first years, even as a small group of people enjoyed the flow of aid coming simultaneously with the implementation of U.S. gender policy, the majority of the people were suspicious of the U.S. promotion of gender equality and women’s rights. Later, people openly expressed opposition to gender equality discourses and, as a result, even women perceived to be working for foreigners or Americans who were promoting gender equality and women’s rights were attacked by men, including in the capital, Kabul.

In a study titled “‘We Are Farkhunda’: Geographies of Violence, Protest, and Performance,” Jennifer Fluri and Rachel Lehr describe the brutal mob killing of a young Lady Farkhonda in Capital Kabul in March 2015. According to the study, an imam accused Farkhunda of being an American agent and burning the Quran: “an act that is considered extremely defamatory to Islam” (151). Despite Farkhunda repeatedly denying the act of burning the Quran, many angry men soon surrounded her, started beating her and dragging her by the hair, kicking her, and finally, as police lost control of the situation, Farkhunda was burned after being killed by a man driving a car on her body (152). Farkhunda’s death provoked women’s rights activists and civil organizations all around the country to protest violence against women, but her case still has not received justice and most of those men involved in her killing walk freely in Kabul city.

However, Farkhunda was not the only woman who was killed in a such brutal way less than two miles away from the presidential palace. On a daily basis, many women face violence and die both in government-controlled regions as well as in Talibancontrolled zones. According to a study titled “Misogyny in post-war Afghanistan: The changing frames of sexual and gender-based violence” by Ahmad Lida and Priscyll Anctil Avoine, violence against women has increased significantly after the invasion of Afghanistan by the U.S. but in a different context. He argues that:

> Fourteen years after … the situation is still unstable, complex and women have been forgotten once again with increasing forms of misogyny that are structurally legitimized by tradition, laws, the international community and the current political situation (97).

This study indicates that the changing frames of violence against women are extensively related to the political situation of the country as public and politicians’ attention is turned to the peace talks between Taliban and the Afghan government (97). Many scholars argue that improvement of Afghan women’s life conditions was not a priority for the Bush administration as it was expressed in women’s rights discourses. These scholars say the Bush administration only pushed their political agendas for invasion of the country in different ways, one of which was the rhetoric of women’s rights and freedom. In the presence of international forces under the leadership of the U.S., with war and conflict between international forces, the Afghan military and terroristic networks continue, Afghan women still are the primary victims, and they are paying a high price in a different context. As most women are suffering, only a few elite families are enjoying the current situation, those in the top positions or those with close ties to the corrupt U.S.-installed Afghan government.

As Maliha Chishti states, while the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan has paved the way for many women to take part in social, political, government and economic activities, the lives of the vast majority of women has not improved at all. As she further states, “bad donor-driven priorities and policies, in addition to aid mismanagement and ineffective implementation, have over the past seven years offered the vast majority of Afghan women very few improvements” (266). Chishti argues that change in the lives of those Afghan women who were benefitting from partnering with the U.S.-installed government of Afghanistan was encouraged by the Bush administration to celebrate the triumph of few people for the whole country: “President Bush insisted on the liberal success over the Taliban, encouraging Americans and Afghans to celebrate the signaling in of a new era of prosperity for the entire country.” Chishti further states:

> The Bush administration clearly set out to distinguish the old (Taliban-ruled) Afghanistan as a country plagued by a shortage of health facilities, disease, poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, and the public and private oppression of women. In contrast, the newly liberated Afghan nation was ostensibly emerging as a strong, changed nation (266).

However, as mentioned in the previous section, those limited improvements in the lives of a small number of women, especially in big cities, was soon followed by increased violence. Facing insecurity, systematic violence from the Taliban, and increased threats, especially in provinces where the government was losing control as the Taliban started getting power, women in most cases chose to leave their jobs and stay home, and girls gradually started postponing school for an unclear future.
