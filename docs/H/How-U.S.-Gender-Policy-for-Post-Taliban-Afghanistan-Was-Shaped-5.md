## Conclusion
The central question of this paper was how U.S. gender policy for post-Taliban Afghanistan was shaped. To answer this question, I have carefully studied existing scholarly literature and credible research papers by high-profile scholars regarding this issue. The findings of this paper indicate that U.S. gender policy for post-Taliban Afghanistan was shaped through the political discourses of Afghan women’s rights and freedoms. During the past nineteen years, the U.S. presence in Afghanistan offered some opportunities for a limited segment of Afghan women, mostly of the middle class and elite families, including opportunities such as access to education, including high-level education in the U.S. universities, job opportunities within the government of Afghanistan and with international institutions and NGOs that were engaged in different activities in Afghanistan after 2001. However, these achievements are not as sustainable as they looked at the beginning of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. As such, the announcement of the U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and increased insecurity obviously indicates that women’s rights, freedoms, and achievements are at stake. As U.S.-Taliban peace negotiations are ongoing in Doha, Qatar, Afghan women’s rights and freedoms are once again on the peace negotiation table. Out of concern, Afghan women are calling on the Afghan government to not compromise their rights and freedoms in peace talks with Taliban. Additionally, active Afghan women are insisting they be included in the ongoing peace talks in order to be able to negotiate and defend women’s rights and their freedom that was granted in Afghanistan’s Constitution in 2014.
