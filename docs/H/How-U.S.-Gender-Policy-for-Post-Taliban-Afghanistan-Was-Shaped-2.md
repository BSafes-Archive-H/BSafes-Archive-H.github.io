## Political Discourses that Shaped U.S. Gender Policy for Post-Taliban Afghanistan
In 2001, U.S. gender policy for Afghanistan was politically shaped in order to justify the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and to attain support from Americans and funding from Congress for war. To justify invasion and war, Afghan women were framed in every possible way as silent prisoners so that Western powers saw it as their moral and political obligation to run and free them. In “Women’s Rights and ‘Righteous War’: An Argument for Women’s Autonomy in Afghanistan,” Gillian Wylie claims that former U.S. president George W. Bush pushed the discourses of Afghan women’s rights and freedom to benefit his agenda of invasion of Afghanistan: “In defending US policy, President George Bush never failed to mention the liberation of women as one of his moral ends. Greeting the fall of Kabul in January, he announced that the mothers and daughters of Afghanistan were now free” (217). But as Wylie’s study shows, the rhetoric of Afghan women’s freedom in the aftermath of U.S. invasion proved to be a delusion (217). Wylie argues that political discourses of women’s rights and freedoms in 2001 was part of the Bush administration’s justification of war. Wylie describes Bush’s approach toward the issue thusly: “Establishing women’s rights became part of the moral justification given for waging ‘war on terror’ by overthrowing the Taliban and ensuring regime change in Afghanistan” (217).

It is worth noticing that under Taliban regime, it was not only women who suffered. Men also were forced to engage in certain practices, including mandatory prayers, keeping beards, and wearing turbans. Focusing just on women’s rights and freedom and their physical appearance has raised many questions in Afghan society as well as in the circle of scholars who follow this issue. Many scholars argue that by focusing on the oppression of women by the Taliban regime, the Bush administration sought to generate empathy and gain support for war. Deniz Kandiyoti argues in “Old Dilemmas or New Challenges? The Politics of Gender and Reconstruction in Afghanistan,” for example, that “the plight of women in Afghanistan was invoked, among other things, as a humanitarian crisis justifying military intervention” (169). Kandiyoti also argues that reversing abuses of women’s rights became an explicit item of policy, at least at the level of rhetoric (169).

The misrepresentation of Afghan women as a political instrument to justify war in Afghanistan not only was a commodity in the political circles of the Bush administration. The U.S. media too had a great role in the representation of Afghan women as oppressed objects who were begging silently for help. Armed Taliban fighters beating poor women screaming in pain under blue burqas were the favorite images of Western media, specifically U.S. media, in 2001 and after. Thus, U.S. mainstream media alongside U.S. policy makers used these miseries of Afghan women to catch attention and support from American citizens and funding from Congress for war in Afghanistan. Presentation of Afghan women in blue burqas covering them head to toe as a sign of oppression was an image that the U.S. media frequently displayed. In 2001 and afterward, one could see such images in television, in newspapers, on the front pages of popular magazines. In the words of Kevin Ayotte and Mary Husain, “the image of the Afghan woman shrouded in the burqa has played a leading role in various public arguments seeking to justify U.S. military intervention” (113). Most Afghan women practiced burqa under Taliban regime coercion but Afghan women had to wear burqa during Mujahedeen rule too, a regime the U.S. directly supported in their fight against the Soviet Union military invasion of Afghanistan. But discourses regarding the urgency of freeing them under the leadership of U.S. military force only emerged significantly when the U.S. wanted to invade Afghanistan. Those political discourses worked, and the Bush administration acquired both funding for war and the support of U.S. taxpayers.

In her study, “The Symbolic Use of Afghan Women in the War on Terror,” Kim Berry states that, “The Bush administration’s focus on the oppression of Afghan women emerged in the midst of the construction and implementation of the ‘war on terror,’ and given that public support for this on-going war is being mobilized through a strategic use of words and images” (138). Furthermore, among political discourses on women’s rights in Afghanistan, Laura Bush’s radio speech is the one which has caught the attention of many scholars who have discussed the issue. Laura Bush, the First Lady of the United States in 2001, delivered on November 17 an emotional radio speech about the situation of Afghan women and children under Taliban rule. Lila Abu-Lughod argues that such cultural framing of women has prevented the serious exploration of the roots and nature of human suffering in this part of the world, and has cited part of Mrs. Bush’s speech as follows:

> …the very separate causes in Afghanistan of women’s continuing malnutrition, poverty, and ill health, and their more recent exclusion under the Taliban from employment, schooling, and the joys of wearing nail polish. On the other hand, her speech reinforced chasmic divides, primarily between the ‘civilized people throughout the world’ whose hearts break for the women and children of Afghanistan and the Taliban-and-the-terrorists, the cultural monsters who want to, as she put it, ‘impose their world on the rest of us’ (784).

Abu-Lughod further argues that such political discourse has hindered experts from deeply exploring the political and historical roots of the problem and its violence. Instead of asking questions acknowledging global interconnections, “experts were being asked to give religio-cultural [responses].… we were offered [questions] that worked to artificially divide the world into … West versus East, us versus Muslims, cultures in which First Ladies give speeches versus others where women shuffle around silently in burqas” (784).

In a study titled “Appropriating Women’s Agendas,” Sally Kitch and Margaret Mills argue that “Laura Bush appropriated women’s issues for U.S. strategic and political purposes and was, in turn, appropriated by her husband for those same purposes” (66). However, Kitch and Mills also argue that subsequent events show that promoting women’s rights and freedom was not the primary goal of Bush administration (66). And, despite significant criticism, U.S. gender policy for postTaliban Afghanistan had received great praise in Afghanistan in the early years as it opened some windows of opportunity for a significant number of women in different parts of the country, even though fragile and short term.
