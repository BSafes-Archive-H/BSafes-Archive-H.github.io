## Introduction
President George W. Bush announced the plan to invade Afghanistan shortly after the 9/11 terroristic attack in the United States. President Bush wanted to chase Osama Bin-Laden and bring him to justice for attacking the United States. At that time, the Taliban, a brutal fundamentalist Islamic regime, was ruling Afghanistan and had close ties with Osama Bin-Laden, the leader of the Al-Qaeda network. The Taliban was giving Bin-Laden safe haven in Afghanistan to hide and live; thus, there was a good reason for President Bush to invade Afghanistan. The Taliban was not only providing safe haven for Al-Qaeda and other terrorist networks, but it also brutally oppressed non-Pashtun citizens, including women.

Through the study of the existing literature and data about the issue, this paper seeks to discover how the U.S. gender policy for post-Taliban Afghanistan was shaped. Furthermore, this paper includes a study of the recent events which are significantly affecting the lives of Afghan women nineteen years after the defeat of the Taliban by the George W. Bush administration. This paper argues that political discourses on Afghan women’s rights and freedoms shaped U.S. gender policy for post-Taliban Afghanistan; however, the achievements of Afghan women from implementation of this policy is entirely fragile. Therefore, nineteen years later, once again, the future and destiny of Afghan women are on the U.S.-Taliban peace negotiation table in Doha, Qatar.
